# Kidz8 Frontend (Vite + React)

This frontend uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with React and TypeScript.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server on <http://localhost:3000>
- `npm run build` – build the application for production
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build

The Docker setup in the repository runs the development server using these scripts.
